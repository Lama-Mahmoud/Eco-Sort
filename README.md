> This App aims to simplify the process of sorting and reuse as much resources as possible. 
>
> Farmers and Recyclers will be able to report factories, industries and companies that don't value nature or humans and violate their rights.
>
> Recyclers will be able to git rid of biodegradable wastes by issuing a recyling request. They can also dispose the other garbage and a team will be taking this garbage to recycle it.
>
> Farmers will get notifications about the places where Biodegradable wastes exist "food scrapes, paper, leftovers, rotten veggies..."
>
> Admins are responsible of handling non biodegradable recycling requests and complains.


### Users Stories
- As a recycler, I want to sort the biodegradable wastes, so that we can reduce the usage of chemical fertilizers
- As a recycler, I want to recycle plastics,metals,oil ...., so we can reuse the stuff and benefit from them again
- As a farmer, I want to produce organic fruits and vegetables, so I will search for biodegradable waste to feed my plants
- As an effective citizn, I wan to report the factories that don't abide by the laws set for nature protection, so I will complain about rules violation

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS and [FireBase](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjyspm62en4AhXlj2gJHUN_BWIYABAAGgJ3Zg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESaOD20f8mO8OQ7oMYk_B54Q23emckfR-aZuHKbpAq6WMRJHgp_VkkHONnrw8jzT-j7U_CAGGY7LD7vqFQtDR71_CwEeplF0vbOcW3mD3CjgKU_iefF6Q2cWPBGdyTRFjJ8RTnbiOwa0z4&sig=AOD64_0mQAahwPRIod5AVGjQOrAEsjz5wA&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiFo5K62en4AhVCr6QKHZ7GCZIQ0Qx6BAgCEAE) by using realtime database.
  - To assist users, the app uses [Dialog Flow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) a chatbot system to
